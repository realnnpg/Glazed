## 🍩 DonutSMP Meteor Client Addon

**Glazed** is a free Meteor Client addon designed specifically for the **DonutSMP** server. I made this to automate the boring and repetitive tasks I kept doing in-game and to give others access to high-quality tools **without paying**. I've seen many paid clients that do less than this one — this is my free alternative.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>🔒 Is it safe to use?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Yes, it's completely open-source. There are no token loggers, backdoors, or obfuscation. If you're unsure, feel free to inspect the code or compile it yourself.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>❓ Why is it free?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I made this addon to help DonutSMP players automate boring tasks without paying ridiculous prices for private clients. It's a free, powerful alternative.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>📦 Can I use this on other servers?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    This addon was made specifically for DonutSMP, and most features are designed to work only there (e.g., Auction Sniper, Auto Sell, RTP Base Finder). While some basic modules may still work elsewhere, the full functionality is best experienced on DonutSMP.
